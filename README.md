# ROOM CAPACITY COUNTER

Computer Science Club Project - by Daniel Turcich ( buffet-time on Github )

(never finished -- might finish up the functionality in the future)

The project is being written in Python due to ease of use with the Raspberry Pi 2 and the hardware being used.
The Python Script will write to a server an Int that is the Room Capacity and will be easily viewed from a Website and an Android App.

For the Fritzing Open Source Hardware file: http://fritzing.org/download/

The hardware used in this project is open sourced in the form of this Fritzing project file. Note that the HC-SR04 sensors are there mainly for visual purposes, I am using 2 HY-SRF05 sensors and are facing away from the wiring. Also the resistors are not exactly correct. The ratio is 2:1 to get the Voltage from 5hz to 3.33Hz.
